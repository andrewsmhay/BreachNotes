# BreachNotes
Various public documents, whitepapers, articles, data, and analysis about breaches

## Contributing
For the moment, it would be nice to have a PDF of the article that we add to the list, just to be sure we always have a copy.

To contribute, you can either:
* Fork, add the report, and send in a pull request; or
* Open an issue with the data you want to be added.

Adding data:
* Add a link to the public document to README.md page.
* Add the PDF file to the appropriate year. If the document is only available in HTML, print a "clean" version (e.g. with [Readability](https://readability.com/), [Clearly](https://evernote.com/clearly/), or similar) to PDF and add that.

If you have any questions, please reach out to @andrewsmhay.
